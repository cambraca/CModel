</code></pre>

<p>CModel is a model template for Zend Framework. Included are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The CModel library (inside the <code>/library/CModel</code> directory)</li>
<li>A sample project</li>
<li>A script for creating the MySQL database used in the sample project (<code>/data/cmodel.sql</code>)</li>
<li>Utility functions for creating your model from existing tables</li>
</ul><h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3+ (this may work in lower versions, but I'm too lazy to test)</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Apache</li>
<li>Zend Framework 1.10.3+ (again, I'm sure you can use older versions, but this is the one I used to create the sample project, and I'm lazy)</li>
</ul><h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="http://pricetaghq.com">Pricetag</a> is a project created by a small team of talented people. I was in charge of programming, and at first I had complete control over how things would work internally. So, after deciding to use Zend Framework as a starting point, the next logical step was building the model. I quickly realized Zend Framework doesn't provide any classes for the Model part of the MVC architecture (despite its excellent support for the other 2 thirds of the equation), so I had to build my own from scratch. I found some advice on the internet, and this thing started to evolve on its own from some basic concepts like lazy loading of related objects.</p>

<p>Some months later, Pricetag is pretty much stable (I, of course, attribute it to the project's excellent foundations, that is, the model), so I wanted to share what I did with the world.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Pricetag was the first time I'd ever worked with this framework, and its documentation has been a bit unhelpful, so I tried to learn the best I could, trial and error, and a lot of time spent looking at its source code. It's been fun, but I'm sure there could be things here that can be done in a much better way.</p>

<p>So, what I'm doing is copying Pricetag's model's base classes and dev tools (a couple of actions in a controller that only gets used in a development environment), and trying to put as much as I can in a separate library. Pricetag's code has everything in one place, but the idea is eventually to use these files as a separate library.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>(instructions on how to use the sample project, and how to import the library to an existing project or create one from scratch)</p>

<h2>To-do</h2>

<ul>
<li>Build a simple but useful sample application to show off the model</li>
<li>Write unit tests for everything</li>
</ul>
